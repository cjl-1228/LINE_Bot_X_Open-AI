<h3>LINE Bot X GPT-3 </h3>
<h2>script</h2>
<h1>written in Python that uses the LINE messaging API, the OpenAI API, and ngrok to create a chatbot. The script first installs the necessary packages such as openai, pyngrok, and line-bot-sdk. Then, it sets up an API key for the OpenAI API and a token for ngrok. The script also starts a connection to ngrok and creates a webhook for the LINE messaging API. When a message is received by the chatbot, it uses the OpenAI API to generate a response to the message and sends the response back to the user via the LINE messaging API.</h1>
